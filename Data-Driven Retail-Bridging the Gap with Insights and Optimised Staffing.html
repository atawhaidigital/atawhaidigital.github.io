                <p> Home delivery is not new to retail.
                    People have been ordering food from the
                    comfort of their homes by calling the restaurants in the 80s and 90s. There
                    would be piles of menu cards lying in the living room. If you feel hungry or don’t
                    feel like cooking, pick up the phone and call the restaurant; within 15-30 minutes,
                    hot food will be delivered straight to your doorstep. You could even order groceries
                    from your local grocery store. Fast forward to the present era, the internet has made
                    it very easy for us to order anything online from the comfort of our rooms.
                    The convenience of online ordering has spread like wildfire, from food to clothing
                    to fresh flowers, and it has undeniably transformed retail markets.</p>

                <p>Many brick-and-mortar stores today face tough competition from their online
                    counterparts like Amazon, Temu, Flipkart, etc. To compete with their online
                    rivals, they have taken cost-cutting measures like reducing the number of
                    store employees and money needed for training. This has hurt their main
                    advantage of having informed and knowledgeable salespeople who can help
                    customers in person. As they fight for their survival in the era of online
                    shopping, retailers must understand the need for knowledgeable staff.
                    The retail industry has faced the problem of high turnover because retailers
                    don’t know how to determine the optimal staffing they need at their stores.
                    As labour cost is the second largest expense, they quickly cut staff or even
                    reduce the number of hours for their salesperson, ignoring that salespeople
                    drive sales. Because of high turnover, retailers spend more on recruitment
                    and sometimes may skim on training. One of the critical solutions retailers
                    can adopt to stay afloat in the market is by looking at and analysing
                    historical data, conducting experiments, tracking training and sales of
                    individuals or teams, and offering attractive commissions.</p>

                <p>By analysing the historical data on sales associates, such as attendance
                    of sales associates, weekly sales, and payroll, they can compare actual sales
                    figures with the forecasts; if they are down by 10%, increasing staff by 10%
                    would most likely raise revenues by 10%. But they also need to consider other
                    forces that affect sales, such as marketing cost, time, weather, etc.; by
                    collecting data and employing machine learning, retailers can create models
                    to predict sales in-store to optimise staffing levels and other drivers
                    that drive sales. One of the critical advantages of collecting required
                    data to forecast sales and employing machine learning data analysis is that
                    it requires minimal effort but rigorously designed experiments to get more
                    accurate results. When analysing the data, they can see whether their
                    brick-and-mortar stores are overstaffed or understaffed. This approach
                    can easily be used in stores and web stores by recognising that sales
                    associates drive sales even in online stores. Sales associates can encourage
                    customers to register online on their website. Optimising staffing is only
                    part of the solution; it is also crucial that associates are trained with
                    product knowledge to increase sales. Research studies have shown that
                    sales rates have increased by 1.8% for associates who participated in training.
                    The average hourly sales of associates who did the training were 46% higher
                    than those who did not participate.</p>

                <p>Another vital part most retailers need to catch up on is customer feedback
                    from potential and existing customers, and sometimes, they even miss out on
                    price-match or price, which may not be the factor customers prefer to shop
                    online instead of in a physical store. It may be the availability, product
                    assortment, or some other aspect of the shopping experience. The point is
                    that gathering all these answers has some promising avenues of opportunities,
                    and this can be backed by collecting feedback from their potential and
                    existing customers instead of relying on their intuition on why customers
                    prefer to shop online instead of going to a physical store. </p>

                <p>Retailers should explore other digital channels and integrate their
                    in-store initiatives with an online strategy. Some shoppers will visit
                    stores to examine the products before buying them online. This trend is
                    called “Showrooming”. The research suggests that about 26% reported regularly
                    engaging in showrooming, and 41% were involved in reverse showrooming,
                    that is, looking for products online and going to physical stores to purchase
                    them. Instead of feeling threatened by online shoppers, retailers should
                    research their customer journey and use the insights gained to sharpen their
                    online marketing efforts.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, the retail landscape has undeniably shifted towards online
                    shopping. While cost-cutting measures like reducing staff may seem appealing,
                    retail stores must recognise the value of knowledgeable sales associates.
                    Analysing sales and payroll data is a crucial tool to optimise staffing
                    levels. Analysing customer feedback is essential to understanding customer
                    needs to create a seamless shopping experience and bridging the gap
                    between physical and online stores. By embracing these strategies,
                    traditional retailers cannot only survive but thrive in the era of
                    online shopping.</p>
