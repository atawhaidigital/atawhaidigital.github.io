                <h1>Using Online Reviews to Build Customer Relationships</h1>

                <p>The Internet has made the world one giant global village. People share their experiences by blogging,
                    writing
                    reviews for the places they visit, posting photos and videos. This user-generated content is a major
                    factor in purchase decisions. Research shows that <a
                        href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/">87% of customers read
                        online reviews</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/customer-reviews-stats/">94% of online shoppers</a>
                    say that they were convinced by the negative reviews to avoid visiting the business.

                    Reviews are thoughts and opinions of consumers on how they perceive a product or a service.
                    People post reviews on a variety of platforms like Google, TripAdvisor and Facebook, while
                    influencers share photos and videos
                    on their personal blogs or social media handles. Reviews don't just drive sales; they act as a
                    digital "vote of confidence"
                    that tells search engines and AI tools your business is trustworthy. In simple terms, the more
                    positive
                    reviews you have, the more likely Google and AI assistants will recommend you first to new
                    customers.

                <p>Tor a business, reviews can be a useful tool to understand their customers.
                    Many online review systems like TripAdvisor have curated guidelines on how businesses
                    can respond to reviews. Responding to reviews can be time-consuming, but <a
                        href="https://hbr.org/2018/02/study-replying-to-customer-reviews-results-in-better-ratings">research
                        shows</a>
                    that ratings improve when businesses respond to both positive and negative reviews.
                </p>
                <p>Positive reviews are a morale booster and the restaurant should take the time to thank
                    their customers for their kind words. Negative reviews obviously hurt, but they can
                    help a business learn from its mistakes and improve customer satisfaction. Lack of
                    timely response to a negative review may impact potential customers. The best thing
                    to do with a negative review is to thank the customer for taking the time to provide
                    valuable feedback and offer to move the conversation to a phone call or email.
                    This way potential customers will see that the business is not pointing fingers
                    and is willing to resolve the issue by moving onto a private platform. Responding to
                    reviews helps the business look trustworthy and being open to feedback and friendly
                    personalised responses can work wonders for the business.</p>
